_So what does that mean to you?_

It means at CAM we have a unique combination of the best medical and alternative treatments available. This unique "marriage" of health procedures and clinical diagnosis is the key to our patients having success in regaining their health.

This means if you have suffered for years with only your symptoms being treated; the doctors at the Center for Advanced Medicine will search for the root cause of your health issues.

This unique approach was created when Dr. Bill Kellas was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis in his late 20's. He began researching alternative health treatments. He discovered a desperate need for a facility that was uniquely integrated with medical doctors, osteopath, chiropractic, nutrition, colonic, message, sauna detox, IV therapy and more. He and Dr. Mark Drucker founded CAM, bringing together all these treatments in one location.

At CAM once a patient is diagnosed and the root cause is identified, a comprehensive treatment plan is discussed with the patient. Our unique case manager will help to facilitate each treatment in the correct order. For example, if your issue is a need to remove heavy metals from your body, it only makes sense that all mercury fillings be removed before the heavy metal removal procedure (chelation).

We have extensive experience helping patients with complicated and challenging health issues as well as more familiar health concerns, such as hormone balancing, anti-aging and helping diagnose the current flu going around.

_What Does This Mean to YOU?_
